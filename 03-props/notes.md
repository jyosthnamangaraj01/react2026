# React Props

- In react *props* means properties.
- They are used to pass data from parent component to child component.

## Characterstics

- Readonly
- From parent to child
- Uni-directional
- Props can pass anything(number, string, array, object...)

## Prop drilling

Prop drilling happens when props are passed through many intermediate components just to reach a deeply needed child.

```js


    App
     |
    Parent
     |
    Child

```
